- 👋 Hi, I’m @lasarte95
- 👀 I’m interested in the Gaming industry. Working as a CS Senior while studying development trying to get more into the industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning development in general. By now just the basics, HTML & CSS, Python, and a little bit of informal personal projects on Unreal 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on indie video games from any kind. I love music (I'm currently a music producer) so I could help while learn along the process
- 📫 You can contact me on my personal gmail (lasartefacu@gmail.com) or via my Instagram profile (@lasarte.ksp)
